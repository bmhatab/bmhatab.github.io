With a background in actuarial science and a Master’s in Financial Insurance from the University of Toronto, I bring hands-on experience in using neural networks and machine learning models for risk and financial modeling. My skills encompass data analysis with Python, database modeling, and data visualization using Microsoft Power BI. I have developed and deployed models on Microsoft Azure, and I possess experience in web development, API integration for applications, and automation using the Python Flask Framework and various automation packages. Furthermore, I have exceptional communication and presentation skills, enabling me to effectively convey technical information as actionable business intelligence.

## Project Portfolio

### American Put Option Evaluation and Hedging
This project applies the Cox, Ross, Rubinstein (CRR) model to evaluate and hedge American put options. It focuses on deriving branching probabilities, evaluating the exercise boundary using different numeraires, and analyzing the impact of volatility and risk-free rates on option pricing and exercise strategies.

#### Applied Skills
- Options Pricing, Stochastic Processes, Risk Management, Monte Carlo Simulation, Python Programming, Data Visualization, Sensitivity Analysis.

### Dynamic Hedging Using the Black-Scholes Model
This project explores the effectiveness of Delta-Gamma hedging within the Black-Scholes model framework. It compares Delta hedging and Delta-Gamma hedging strategies in terms of profit and loss outcomes and the impact of varying drift and real-world volatility on these strategies

#### Applied Skills
- Options Pricing, Stochastic Processes, Risk Management, Monte Carlo Simulation, Python Programming, Data Visualization, Sensitivity Analysis.

### Greek Hegding Strategies
This project aims to identify the best strategies for hedging liability fluctuations in various market conditions, ensuring a consistent portfolio structure to mitigate balance sheet impacts due to liability volatility.

#### Applied Skills
- Option Pricing and Greeks, Hedging Strategies, Financial Modeling, Risk Management, Market Analysis, Quantitative Analysis.

### Classification and Prediction of the VIX – Volatility Index
This project investigates the classification of the VIX (Volatility Index) into regimes based on the recent past returns of the S&P 500 index. It explores the relationship between the VIX regimes and the distribution of S&P 500 returns, and constructs classifiers to predict the current day's VIX regime based on historical returns. The study involves data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and validation using various classification models.

#### Applied Skills
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Conditional Distribution Analysis, Predictive Modeling, Python Programming, Model Evaluation.

### Mixture Models of VIX and S&P 500
This project investigates the use of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to classify the states of the VIX and S&P 500 index based on their log-returns. The study aims to develop a latent representation of the state of the market, classify the data, and interpret the regimes. The project involves data preprocessing, model fitting, plotting marginal and joint distributions, and classifying the data based on the posterior probabilities of the latent states.

#### Applied Skills
- Data Collection, Data Preprocessing, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Marginal Distribution Analysis, Conditional Distribution Analysis, Data Classification, Python Programming, Scikit-Learn Library, Data Visualization.

### VAE Modeling of Implied Volatility Smiles
This project utilizes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model to fit and analyze the distribution of implied volatility (IV) smiles for Intel (INTC) call options. The IV is defined as the volatility used in the Black-Scholes model such that the market price equals the model price. The goal is to model the IV curves across a fixed set of deltas using a VAE, perform exploratory data analysis, train the model, and generate new data based on varying latent space values.

#### Applied Skills
- Data Preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Modeling, Implied Volatility Analysis, Data Visualization, Python Programming, Machine Learning, Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow Libraries

### Reinforcement Learning for Statistical Arbitrage
This project aims to develop an optimal trading strategy using Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) to maximize the discounted profit of a trader in a statistical arbitrage scenario. The mid-prices of two assets evolve according to specified stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The trader takes actions representing inventory positions in each asset while considering transaction costs. The study involves data simulation, model training, strategy development, and performance evaluation using heat maps and histograms.

#### Applied Skills
- Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), Data Simulation, Reinforcement Learning (DDQN), Statistical Arbitrage, Heat Map Generation, Reward Distribution Analysis, Python Programming, Machine Learning, TensorFlow and Keras Libraries.
  
### Business Analysis Automation
- Streamlined and automated a business analysis catalogue of tools used to assess the entirety of a client’s business.
- Generated comprehensive report presentations on gaps in client’s business operations and recommendations to cover those gaps.

### Dynamic Visualization Dashboards
- Designed and developed dynamic visualization dashboards using Power BI to generate sales and performance reports.
- Automated file retrieval processes from servers using Python, significantly reducing manual workload.

### Blockchain Explorer Freelance Project
- Utilized web scraping techniques to extract Ethereum contract addresses from GitHub.
- Mapped contract addresses to their respective domain or subdomain, submitting data in JSON format.
